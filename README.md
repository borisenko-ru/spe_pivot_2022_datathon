## PIVOT 2022 SPE Datathon

Geothermal field development plan completed for [PIVOT 2022 SPE Datathon](https://www.spegcs.org/events/6411) organized by SPE Gulf Coast Section, SPE Calgary, SPE Data Science and Engineering Analytics as part of [PIVOT 2022](https://geo.touchcast.com/showtime/pivot2022/join) - the 5-day conference focused on addressing contemporary geothermal topics through spirited panels, roundtables, competitions, and fireside chats.

In this competition, we evaluate a hypothetical scenario where the FORGE location (Utah) is an EGS production field and the first FORGE highly deviated well (16A) is the injection well. Based on the provided model results, we seek the theoretical optimum placement of the production well that maximizes the likelihood of achieving maximum net energy and electrical power output over a 20 year project lifespan, accounting for parasitic losses.
